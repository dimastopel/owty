One Wort; Two Yeasts
====================

Recently, I [brewed](http://seancoates.com/brews) 10 gallons (~40L) of a
[cream ale](http://seancoates.com/brews/cacnaca). I decided to split the wort
between two yeasts (5 gallons/~20L each):
[Wyeast 2112](http://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=131) and
[Safale US-05](http://www.fermentis.com/fo/60-Beer/60-11_product_rangeHB.asp).

The two beers were fermented, side-by-side, at the same temperature, in vessels
of the same geometry.

These two photos were taken a little less than two days after pitching.

Visit [http://j.mp/onewort](http://j.mp/onewort) and use the "swipe" or
"onion skin" views for the best comparison.

Amazing how much difference *just* the yeast can make.
